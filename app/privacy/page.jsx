        <p className="mb-4">
          When you register with us through the Site and become a Member and
          when you choose to host a Tournament or sign up for one, or when you
          wish to contact another Member, we will ask you for personally
          identifiable information. This refers to information about you that
          can be used to contact or identify you ("Identity Information").
          Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone
          number, email address and home postal address, but does not include
          your credit card number or billing information. In order to process
          some of your transactions through the Site, we may also ask for your
          credit card number and other billing information ("Billing
          Information") (Identity Information and Billing Information together,
          "Personal Information"). Some Personal Information is required, like
          your name and email address, and other Personal Information is
          optional, like your home address. We reserve the right to require
          address confirmation for Tournament locations.

        <p className="mb-4">
          We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration
          to join the Service.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can register to join via the Site by completing the required
          forms. You can also register to join by logging into online accounts
          you may have with third party service providers ("SNS") (e.g.
          Facebook); each such account, a "Third Party Account", via our Site or
          Application as described below. As part of the functionality of the
          Site, you may link your MatScout Account with Third Party Accounts, by
          either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to
          MatScout through the Site or (ii) allowing MatScout to access your
          Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and
          conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You
          represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account
          login information to MatScout and/or grant MatScout access to your
          Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the
          purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms
          and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party
          Account and without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject
          to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable SNS. If you decide
          to register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Site, we
          will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the
          applicable SNS (such as your "real" name, email address, profile
          picture, names of SNS friends, names of SNS groups to which you
          belong, other information you make publicly available via the
          applicable SNS and/or other information you authorize MatScout to
          access by authorizing the SNS to provide such information) from your
          Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your MatScout
          Account and MatScout Account profile page and you will become a
          Member. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject
          to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party
          Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party
          Accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and
          as permitted by the SNS and authorized by you) the information in your
          Third Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your
          MatScout Account on the Site, Service and Application. If there is
          information about your "friends" or people with whom you are
          associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain
          about those "friends" or people with whom you are associated, may also
          depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable
          SNS.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We also collect the other information that you provide as part of
          registration and the administration and personalization of your
          MatScout Account profile (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its
          own) and individual preferences or demographic information)
          ("Non-Identifying Information").

        <p className="mb-4">
          We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with
          your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service,
          complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your
          Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for
          example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way
          that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information
          are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone
          or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example,
          your demographic information). We may combine your Personal
          Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with
          information collected from other MatScout Users (defined below) to
          attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the
          quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our
          Site is used. We may also use the combined information without
          aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a
          product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We also use your Personal Information to contact you with MatScout
          newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information
          that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no
          longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the
          unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or

          that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their

          The Site can be used to facilitate the creation and entering of

          on their websites through the use of an HTML "widget". We may also
          display the geographical location of your Tournament in the form of a
          map so that potential Guests can see the general area and neighborhood
          of your Tournament, but your actual street address will not be
          disclosed until you enter into a confirmed transaction with another
          Member.

        <p className="mb-4">
          If you request to enter a tournament via the Site, We will share the
          following information about you with the applicable Tournament Host:
          (i) your first and last name, (ii) a link to your MatScout Account
          profile page, (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you
          are "friends" or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also
          "friends" or associated with the Tournament Host on such SNS, and (iv)
          an indication that the name that you provided to MatScout when you
          became a Member matches the name that you provided to the SNSs to
          which you have linked your MatScout Account. All of this information
          will enable the Tournament Host to decide whether to confirm or reject
          your entry. When a Tournament Host confirms an entry we will share
          pieces of the Tournament Host’s Identity Information, including, but
          not limited to, full name, phone number, the Tournament’s location and
          the Tournament Host’s email address, with the Applicant selected by
