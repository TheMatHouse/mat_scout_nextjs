          Tournaments
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a Member, you may create Tournaments. To create a Tournament, you
          will be asked a variety of questions about the Tournament, including
          but not limited to, the location, start, end, entry deadline,
          divisions, pricing and related rules and terms. In order to be
          featured via the Site and Services, all Tournaments must have valid
          physical locations. Tournaments will be made publicly available via
          the Site and Services after they are published. Other Members will be
          able to enter the Tournament via the Site and Services based upon the
          information provided about your Tournament. You understand and agree
          that once a Member enters a tournament individually or enters a team,
          you may not request the Member to pay a higher price than it was
          requested when Tournament was published. You acknowledge and agree
          that you are responsible for any and all Tournaments you create.
          Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Tournament your create
          and the entering in your Tournament by a Member (i) will not breach
          any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, and (ii)
          will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements,
          and rules and regulations that may apply to your Tournament (including
          having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not
          conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that RS, LLC
          assumes no responsibility for a Tournament Host’s compliance with any
          agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and
          regulations. RS, LLC reserves the right, at any time and without prior
          notice, to remove or disable access to any Tournaments for any reason,
          including Tournaments that RS, LLC, in its sole discretion, considers
          to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or
          otherwise harmful to the Site or Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a Tournament Host, you understand and agree that MatScout
          does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          MatScout may offer Tournament Hosts the option of having photographers
          take photographs of their Tournaments. If you as a Tournament Host
          choose to have a photographer do this, the photographs taken will be
          made available to you to include in your Tournament with a watermark
          or tag bearing the words “MatScout.com Verified Photo” or similar
          wording (“Verified Images”). All images, materials and content created
          by these photographers provided by MatScout, including Verified
          Images, constitute MatScout Content, regardless of whether you include
          them in your Tournament.

          No Endorsement
        </h2>

          MatScout does not endorse any Member or any Tournament. You understand
          that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic
          representation of the Tournament at the time the photograph was taken.
          Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by RS, LLC of any
          Member or any Tournament. Members are required by these Terms to
          provide accurate information, and although RS, LLC may undertake
          additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the
          identities or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations
          about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member’s purported
          identity or background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any references in the Site or Services to a Member being “verified” or
          “connected” (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has
          completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent
          anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement,
          certification or guarantee by RS, LLC about any Member, including of
          the Member’s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or
          suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful
          information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about
          the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact
          with via the Site and Services. We therefore recommend that you always
          exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to enter a
          Tournament or to accept an entry in your Tournament, or to have any
          other interaction with any other Member. We are not responsible for
          any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other
          Members.

        <p>
          By using the Site or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or
          liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other
          Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the
          particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You
          agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy
          from RS, LLC with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly,
          we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the
          Site and Services regarding any Tournaments you have entered. This
          limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Tournament Host against
          RS, LLC regarding the remittance of payments received from a Member by
          MatScout on behalf of a Tournament Host, which instead shall be
          subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled
          “Limitation of Liability”.
